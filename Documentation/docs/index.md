# Welcome to Kratos

## About
Kratos is a machine learning project developed by a team of Computer Science students at [Portland State University](https://www.pdx.edu) for their [Capstone](https://www.pdx.edu/computer-science/capstone).

The Kratos project uses Tensorflow and PyTorch frameworks to render predictions of clothing descriptions from an image. Models were trained using images from the [Deep Fashion Database](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) developed by researchers from the Chinese University of Hong Kong.
