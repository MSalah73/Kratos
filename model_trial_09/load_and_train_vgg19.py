'''
load_and_train_vgg19.py:

   - Run this file to create the initial H5 weights file
     as well as create three .csv files in the Acc_data directory.

   - Note: Each (.csv) file will have two values once this 
     program ends. It will have the accuracy rate before 
     training and one for after training.

   - Note: if there is an existing weight file with the same name,
     this file overwrites it as well as all of the accuracy data, 
     run only once for specific parameter modifications. 
     (modifications can be made in the model_architecture_vgg19.py file)
